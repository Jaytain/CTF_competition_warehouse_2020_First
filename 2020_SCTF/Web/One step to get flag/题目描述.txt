Try to bypass a mounted Rails engine WAF that rudely blocks all access to the /getflag.

8.208.89.219:8080/getflag

Hint1:
  config/route.rb:
  Waf::Engine.routes.draw do
    get '*all', to: 'requests#block'
  end

  get 'getflag', to: 'application#getflag'

Hint2:
  RoR follows the "Convention Over Configuration" principle, e.g., there is some sort of routing convention between the high-level Rails apps
