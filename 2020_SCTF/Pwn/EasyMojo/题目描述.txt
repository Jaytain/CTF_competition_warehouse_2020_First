Before exploiting you need to send a string which length is 36 as your token.
When you choose to upload a .zip, remember to put all .html and .js into the root of the .zip, and then name the webpage to be loaded as "exploit.html".
Once you exploit successfully, execute "C:\Users\pwnbox\EasyMojo\readflag.exe <token>" to get flag.

If you don't exploit once, try a few more times. And if the server is not responding immediately, it may be because the maximum number of connections has been reached, please be patient.

hint1:
```python
def POW(sample_hash):
    for c in itertools.product(string.printable[0:36], repeat=5):
        sample = f"SCTF{''.join(c)}"
        if sha256(sample.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() == sample_hash:
            return sample

```
hint2:
ROP is very unstable :)
